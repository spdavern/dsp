[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

Exercise 2.4 Using the variable totalwgt_lb, investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others. Compute Cohenâ€™s d to quantify the difference between the groups. How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length?

>> The computed difference in average weight between first babies (7 lb 3 oz, n=4,363) and the others (7 lb 5 oz, n=4,675) is 2 oz which is just less than 0.09 standard deviations different (Cohen's d).  This is 3 times larger than Cohen's d for the difference in pregnancy length (1/2 day longer).  The p-value (2.6e-5) testing for equivalence in average weights suggests the difference, while small is statistically significant.

Below is a condensed collection of code that reproduces the above results:
